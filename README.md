# ILE_MPE
These Simulink examples are released to examine the effects of three-phase faults on a Mathworks Simulink example simulating Kundur's test system. 
The original file is available on the following website:
https://www.mathworks.com/help/sps/ug/performance-of-three-pss-for-interarea-oscillations.html


We add the proposed stability indicators, ILE, MPE1, MPE2, MPE3, and MPE to the above Mathworks sample file.
We release two Simulink files: "power_PSS_example1.slx" and "power_PSS_example2.slx".


The input of the file "power_PSS_example1.slx" is a  signal is the difference between the rotor angle of the Machine 1 and the Machine4.
The input signal of the file "power_PSS_example2.slx" is the active power from the bus B1 to B2.
